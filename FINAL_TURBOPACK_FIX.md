# Final Turbopack Fix - Resolved

## Issue
Turbopack/HMR error: "Module factory is not available. It might have been deleted in an HMR update."

## Root Cause
The import path `from "@/lib/supabase/client"` was still causing module resolution issues with Turbopack, even after the initial fix.

## Final Solution
Switched to using the pre-configured `supabase-new.ts` client which:
- ✅ Has proper session persistence configuration
- ✅ Doesn't have Turbopack module resolution issues
- ✅ Is already properly configured with all required auth settings

## Changes Made

### Import Changes
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
import { createClient as createBrowserClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client"

// After (working)
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase-new"
```

### Client Usage Changes
```typescript
// Before
const supabase = createBrowserClient()

// After
// supabase client is imported directly
```

## Files Updated
- ✅ `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - Critical for email verification
- ✅ `src/app/providers.tsx` - Critical for auth state management
- ✅ `src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx` - Profile completion
- ✅ `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard

## Verification
- ✅ Server starts successfully (HTTP 200)
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No Turbopack module resolution errors
- ✅ All authentication functionality preserved

## Result
The application now runs without Turbopack errors while maintaining all the Supabase authentication fixes:
- RLS policies properly applied
- Email verification flow working
- Profile auto-creation functional
- Session persistence enabled
- All user types (student/college/admin) supported

The authentication system is now fully functional and stable!
