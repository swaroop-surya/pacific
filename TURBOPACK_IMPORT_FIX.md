# Turbopack Import Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Turbopack/HMR error: "Module factory is not available. It might have been deleted in an HMR update."

## Root Cause
The import path `from "@/lib/supabase"` was causing module resolution issues with Turbopack's Hot Module Replacement system.

## Solution Applied
Changed all imports from:
```typescript
import { createBrowserClient } from "@/lib/supabase"
```

To:
```typescript
import { createClient as createBrowserClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client"
```

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/providers.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/auth/signup/college/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/colleges/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/quiz/page.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/NotificationSystem.tsx`

## Verification
- All problematic imports have been resolved
- No linting errors detected
- Direct import from client module prevents circular dependencies

## Result
The authentication flow should now work without Turbopack module resolution errors. The application should start and run properly with all Supabase client functionality intact.
