# Apply Supabase Authentication Fixes

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Apply RLS Policy Fixes
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of FINAL_CLEAN_RLS_FIX.sql
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Configure Supabase Auth Settings
In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > URL Configuration and add:
- Site URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Redirect URLs: 
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3000/**` (for development)

### 4. Test the Fixes
Follow the testing guide in `AUTHENTICATION_TEST_GUIDE.md`

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ RLS Policies
- Removed duplicate INSERT policies
- Created clean policies for profiles table
- Ensured newly verified users can insert their own profiles

### ✅ Supabase Client Configuration
- Added `persistSession: true` and `autoRefreshToken: true`
- Added `detectSessionInUrl: true` for proper callback handling

### ✅ Auth Callback Handler
- Changed from `getSession()` to `getUser()` for fresh user data
- Added automatic profile creation with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### ✅ Profile Creation Logic
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Added fallback to complete-profile page if auto-creation fails
- Improved user metadata handling

### ✅ Auth State Management
- Updated providers to use `getUser()` for fresh data
- Added automatic profile creation on auth state changes
- Improved error handling throughout

### ✅ Server-Side API
- Created `/api/auth/create-profile` endpoint for manual profile creation
- Added proper authentication and error handling

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Email Verification Flow:**
   - User signs up → receives email → clicks verification link
   - Redirected to `/auth/callback` → profile auto-created → redirected to dashboard

2. **Login Flow:**
   - User logs in → profile loaded → dashboard accessible
   - No "unauthorized" errors

3. **Role Assignment:**
   - Students get `role: 'student'`
   - Colleges get `role: 'college'`
   - Admins get `role: 'admin'`

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Detailed console logs for debugging
   - Graceful fallbacks if profile creation fails
   - Clear error messages for users
