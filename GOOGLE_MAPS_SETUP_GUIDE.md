The Google Maps Nearby Colleges feature is now using **real Google Maps data** with your configured API key.

## Required APIs

Make sure these APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud Console:

- **Geocoding API** (for address conversion)

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Failed to fetch nearby colleges":
